Install varnish 
-----------------
apt-get install varnish. 

Configure varnish
-------------------
One with the starter parameter:

/etc/default/varnish
This file contains all the starter parameters.

The other is the default VCL file:

For systemd, the VCL file is directed in a different manner. It will be located in:

/etc/systemd/system/varnish.service
which will point to:

/etc/varnish/default.vcl
However, there is a builtin.vcl that is always appended to the VCL you define/specify in this default.vcl.


Open /etc/default/varnish in a text editor
You will see a code like the one below

DAEMON _OPTS="-a :80\
  -T localhost:6082
  -f /etc/varnish/default.vcl
  -s malloc,256m"
  -S /etc/varnish/secret

 Configure your web server

Configure your web server to listen on a port other than the default port 80 because Varnish responds directly to incoming HTTP requests, not the web server.

In the sections that follow, we use port 8080 as an example.
